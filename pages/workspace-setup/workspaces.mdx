# Workspaces

The first step to using Linear is to create a workspace for your team.

import Image from "../../components/Image";

## Overview

A workspace is the home for all issues and interactions for an organization. We recommend organizations staying within a single workspace as this is the conceptual model we use when designing the product.
When a workspace is created, Linear automatically creates a default Team with the same name.

## Workspace Settings

Navigate to Settings > Workspace > Preferences by clicking the workspace name in the upper left and select Preferences.

Admins will be able to:

- Update a Workspace name and URL
- Manage log-in preferences and turn on/off third-party app review requirements (Paid feature)
- Set up Project Updates feature
- Turn off the Initiatives feature
- Add or remove members to the Workspace
- Import or export issues
- Change plans
- View or update billing information
- Configure workspace-specific integrations like GitHub and GitLab, Slack, Figma, and Sentry. These can be configured by anyone in your workspace as long as they have the required permissions from the integrated service.

Admins and Members will be able to:

- Create workspace-level labels
- Create custom project statuses
- Create workspace-level templates for issues, projects, and documents
- Apply SLA rules (paid feature)
- Customize Asks templates (paid feature)
- Add custom emojis
- View your plan type

### Delete workspace

Deleting a workspace includes deleting user and issue data. Admins can delete a workspace under Settings > Workspace > General. Please note this action is not reversible.

## Multiple workspaces

You can create multiple workspaces in Linear under a single account (e.g. tied to a specific email). If you are using Linear for both work and personal purposes, we recommend you create multiple Linear accounts with separate email addresses.
To add a workspace from another email account:

1. Click on your workspace name in the top left corner
1. Hover over Switch workspace.
1. Select Create or join a workspace.
1. Select Create or join a workspace.
1. If you have other workspaces associated with your user account, you will see a list of those workspaces to select.
